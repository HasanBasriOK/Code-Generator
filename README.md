# Code-Generator

I developed this app at University

This app developed for class generate with entity and data tier.
In n-tier architecture entity and data acces tiers are different but i developed these tiers are like one thing.

I used SMO(SQL MANAGEMENT OBJECTS) Library in this project.User select a database and click a button then this app generate class for ADO.NET operations like declare properties for columns and create methods for CRUD operations.

Generated codes are writing a file with .cs extension and somebody can exclude this .cs file on their projects.


This app while generating code carefully about identity,nullability etc features.
I hope it helps for you
